            <p>
                Getting born in the state of Mississippi
                Papa was a copper, and her mama was a hippy
                In Alabama she would swing a hammer
                Price you got to pay when you break the panorama
                She never knew that there was anything more than poor
                What in the world does your company take me for?
                Black bandanna, sweet Louisiana
                Robbing on a bank in the state of Indiana
                She's a runner
                Rebel, and a stunner
                On her merry way saying baby, watcha gonna?
                Looking down the barrel of a hot metal forty-five
                Just another way to survive
            </p>
            <p>
                California, rest in peace
                Simultaneous release
                California, show your teeth
                She's my priestess
                I'm your priest
                Yeah, yeah, yeah
            </p>
            <p>
                She's a lover, baby, and a fighter
                Should've seen it coming when I got a little brighter
                With a name like Dani California
                Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya
                A little loaded, she was stealing another breath
                I love my baby to death
            </p>
            <p>
                California, rest in peace
                Simultaneous release
                California, show your teeth
                She's my priestess
                I'm your priest
                Yeah, yeah, yeah
            </p>
            <p>
                Who knew the other side of you?
                Who knew that others died to prove?
                Too true to say goodbye to you
                Too true to say, say, say
            </p>
            <p>
                Pushed the fader, gifted animator
                One for the now, and eleven for the later
                Never made it up to Minnesota
                North Dakota man
                Wasn't gunnin' for the quota
                Down in the Badlands she was saving the best for last
                It only hurts when I laugh
                Gone too fast
            </p>
