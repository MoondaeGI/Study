                <p>Getting born in the state of Mississippi</p>
                <p>Papa was a copper, and her mama was a hippy</p>
                <p>In Alabama she would swing a hammer</p>
                <p>Price you got to pay when you break the panorama</p>
                <p>She never knew that there was anything more than poor</p>
                <p>What in the world does your company take me for?</p>
                <p>Black bandanna, sweet Louisiana</p>
                <p>Robbing on a bank in the state of Indiana</p>
                <p>She's a runner</p>
                <p>Rebel, and a stunner</p>
                <p>On her merry way saying baby, watcha gonna?</p>
                <p>Looking down the barrel of a hot metal forty-five</p>
                <p>Just another way to survive</p>

                <p>With a name like Dani California</p>
